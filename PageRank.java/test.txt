(unix) how do i print something in the lab? (windows) how do i contact the cs system administrator? what does cs mean? cs stands for computer science. how do i use the card reader? make sure the light on the card reader is green. hold your ranger card so that the magnetic strip is on the right and swipe it through the card reader. the light will flash amber. enter your pin using the numbers on the card reader. the light will flash green and the reader will make a beeping sound for 5 seconds. pull the door open before it stops. if the lights flash red, try again. if trying to access the lab fails repeatedly, contact your cs instructor or the cs system administrator. see also: what do i do if the light on the card reader is not green? how do i contact my cs instructor? how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i access my computer account in the cs computer lab? if you qualify, you will be given an account on cs.uwp.edu. before using the account you must fill out and sign a unix account policy form and do the initial setup of your account. for most people, this is done in the first lab of the csci 145 or 241 course. if for some reason you did not activate your account, contact the cs system administrator for assistance. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i choose a good password? the password you select for the cs computer lab must be a minimum of 8 characters long and contain at least one letter at least one number and at least one symbol. your password should be easy for you to remember and secure enough no one can guess it. your password should not contain any public information such as address, phone number, birthday, pet name, etc. which would be easy to find out or guess. your password should be long and should not contain any commonly known words. your password should contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and other characters such as punctuation marks or symbols. keep your password secure. this includes not telling anyone what your password is. you should use a different password for every account you access. for greater security, passwords should be changed regularly. see also: what are some methods for choosing a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? choose a word and replace some of the letters with numbers or symbols so that the original word is unrecognizable. or choose a phrase, such as the first line of your favorite song, use the first letter of each word of the phrase, and insert punctuation marks and numbers. or choose a common word, but as you type it offset your fingers on the keyboard one or two places up, down, or sideways. the typed word will then look like gibberish. or the possibilities are endless, use your own method. see also: how do i choose a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i use the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) typically, all machines are powered up, with the monitors turned off. turn on monitor. if the screen is black, move the mouse or press the escape key to wake it up. if the screen is locked, or someone forgot to log out, report it to the cs system administrator. enter your cs login and password. remember to log off when done. if you are only going to be gone 2 or 3 minutes, lock your screen and leave your books/papers by the workstation. do not turn off any of the computers. these are accessed from remote locations and others may be using them at the same time. (except for the dual-boot machines. if you are not sure if a machine is dual-boot, do not shut it down or restart it.) if there is a problem with a machine, please notify the cs system administrator. see also: how do i log in to the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) how do i lock my machine? (unix) how do i log out? (unix) how do i change my cs password? you must change your password on the lab server. from a terminal session logged into the lab: type the command ssh ginger and press enter. if you see a message that looks like the following: the authenticity of host 'ginger (131.210.12.7)' can't be established. rsa key fingerprint is 89:b8:3b:12:7b:c7:0d:93:09:c2:4b:f8:5f:71:7f:6f. are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? type yes and press enter. enter your password. nothing will show up on the screen as you type. this is done for security purposes. you should see this: ==================================================== you may only change your password on this server type ctrl-d to exit without changing your password ==================================================== changing password for username (current) unix password: enter your current password. nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password. again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password again. once again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. you will see the message passwd: password updated successfully. the connection will close and you will be returned to the lab machine. see also: how do i choose a good password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i get a secure login to the cs computer lab from the outside world? (unix) use ssh (secure shell). secure shell encrypts the terminal connection including your password so no data is transmitted in clear, readable text. the lab machines are not accessible from off campus using telnet or ftp. to access the lab with ssh, you will need to get an ssh client (workstation) software installed on the machine you want to access the lab from. it should be installed by default on a unix machine. to access the lab type the command ssh -l <login> lab.cs.uwp.edu or sftp <login>@lab.cs.uwp.edu where <login> is your cs login. supply your cs password when prompted. you do not need to use a key. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i use one of the lockers in the lab? anyone with access to the lab may use a locker if any are available. the lockers are assigned on a first come, first served basis. in order to use a locker, you must register your intent with the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what are the lab rules? all guests must be escorted while in the lab. with the exception of special 'events' preapproved by the chairperson of the department, the cs computer lab is for use by cs students with a cs account only. treat the furniture well. make sure to wipe up spills at the conference table. keep your shoes off the furniture. return all items to their proper place. food and drinks are allowed on the north side of the lab by the conference table but not elsewhere. do not forget to log off completely and turn off the monitor when you are finished using a lab computer. (turning off the monitor saves power.) clean up your area when you are through working at either the conference table and/or a workstation. push your chair in and clean up your papers. recycle unwanted papers including the banner pages for printing jobs in the blue recycle containers. recycle cans and bottles in the appropriate container. other garbage goes in the brown lined container. offenders may lose access to the lab and/or to their account. repeat offenders will lose access. not keeping the lab clean and in good order could cause everyone to lose the privilege of having food and/or drink in the lab. see also: how do i log out?

The CIS degree at UW-Parkside is designed for students seeking credentials for entry into the information technology professional workforce or for those seeking professional advancement. The CIS curriculum is oriented more towards practicality than most graduate programs in CS, while providing more technically oriented study than most graduate programs in IS. What if I do not have an undergraduate degree in CS or MIS? It is not necessary to have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Management Information Systems to be successful in our CIS program. If you have a solid math background which includes algebra and geometry, our two prerequisite classes, CSCI 145 or 241 and CSCI 242, will complete the preparation needed. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? This depends on your prior coursework and background. Please see the list of prerequisite classes. See Also: Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Normally, graduate-level classes in CS or MIS can be counted towards your CIS degree if the content is similar to CIS required courses. A maximum of 12 semester hours of graduate work may be transferred into the CIS program. Transfer eligibility depends on the content and level of those classes, and you must have received a B (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher before they can be considered. See Also: What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How long will it take me to complete my CIS degree? Without any prerequisite courses, plan to arrive for the fall semester and expect the CIS program to be completed in two years of full time study. With sufficient background, it is possible to complete the program in one-and-a-half years of full time study or three years of part-time study. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? At what time of day and days of the week are CIS courses offered? Most CIS courses are offered in the evenings, but some classes may be offered during the day. Each summer one or two classes will be offered, or it is possible to arrange to complete a course through independent study. How do I burn an iso to a CD or DVD in the CS Computer Lab?
